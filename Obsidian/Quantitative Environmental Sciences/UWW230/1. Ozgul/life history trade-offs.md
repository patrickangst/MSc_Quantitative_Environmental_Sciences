- The most prominent life-history trade-off is the cost of reproduction (Stearns 1989) in terms of survival and future reproduction
	- Reproduce or survive? Now or later?  
* [[Reproductive value]] = Current Reproduction + [[Residual Reproductive Value]]

Intra-individual trade-offs:  
* Current reproduction vs. survival
* Current vs. future production
* Reproduction vs. growth  
* Reproduction vs. condition
* Number vs. size of offspring  
* Number vs. survival of offspring

Inter-generational trade-offs (parent-offspring conflicts):
* Number of offspring vs. parental survival  
* Offspring condition vs. parental survival
