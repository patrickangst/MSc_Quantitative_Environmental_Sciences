Biological invasions are a significant conservation problem because they can have detrimental impacts on native ecosystems, [[native species]], and biodiversity. When non-native species are introduced to new environments, they can disrupt the balance of local ecosystems and lead to a range of ecological, economic, and environmental issues. Here are some reasons why biological invasions are a conservation concern, along with examples:

1. Displacement of Native Species: Invasive species can outcompete, displace, or prey upon native species, leading to declines in native populations. For example, the introduction of the brown tree snake to Guam has caused the extirpation of several native bird species.

2. Altered Ecosystem Dynamics: Invasive species can change the structure and functioning of ecosystems. For instance, the invasive Eurasian watermilfoil can dominate aquatic systems and alter the composition of native aquatic plants, affecting water quality and fish habitat.

3. Loss of Biodiversity: Invasive species can reduce biodiversity by directly or indirectly causing the decline or extinction of native species. The invasion of zebra mussels in North American waters has led to the decline of some native freshwater mussel species.

4. Economic Impact: Invasive species can have substantial economic costs, such as damage to agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. The spread of the emerald ash borer in North America has resulted in the loss of millions of ash trees, impacting the timber industry and urban landscapes.

5. Human Health Concerns: Some invasive species, like certain mosquitoes or ticks, can carry diseases that pose a risk to human health. For example, the Asian tiger mosquito is an invasive species that can transmit diseases like Zika virus and dengue fever.

6. Ecosystem Services: Invasions can disrupt ecosystem services, such as pollination, water purification, and carbon sequestration. The spread of the European honeybee in regions where it is not native has had both positive and negative impacts on pollination and native pollinators.

7. Habitat Alteration: Invasive plants, like kudzu in the southeastern United States, can alter habitat structure and make it less suitable for native wildlife.

8. Genetic Swamping: Invasive species can interbreed with closely related native species, leading to genetic dilution and the loss of unique genetic diversity in native populations.

Conservation efforts often focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of invasive species through measures like early detection, rapid response, and the development of control and eradication strategies. Preventing the introduction of invasive species through measures like stricter regulations on the importation of goods and ballast water from ships is also an essential component of conservation efforts to address this pressing problem.
