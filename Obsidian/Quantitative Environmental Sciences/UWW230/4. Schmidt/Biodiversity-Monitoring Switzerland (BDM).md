- Gaining a better understanding of biodiversity
- Providing a basis for nature conservation policy
- Testing efficacy of national policy
- therefore we want to:
	- illustrate relevant trends over a long time period
	- provide sound datasets for ongoing research
	- gather background information for other programs

Information needed:
1. What kind of information are decision-makers asking for?
2. What information do decision-makers really need?
3. How can this information be generated on a scientific basis?
4. What will be the quality (precision, variability, sensitivity) of the information?
