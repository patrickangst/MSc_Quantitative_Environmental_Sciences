The "diversity-resistance hypothesis" is a concept in ecology that suggests that ecosystems with higher levels of species diversity are more resistant to various ecological disturbances, such as invasive species, diseases, or environmental changes. This hypothesis proposes that diverse ecosystems are better able to withstand and recover from disruptions compared to less diverse ecosystems.

Key points about the diversity-resistance hypothesis:

1. Species Diversity: The hypothesis focuses on the number of different species present in an ecosystem, as well as the variety of ecological roles and functions they perform.

2. Resistance to Disturbances: Ecosystems with higher species diversity are thought to be more resistant to perturbations because they have a broader array of species that may respond differently to the disturbance. Some species may be better equipped to deal with the specific threat, helping to maintain ecosystem stability.

3. Redundancy and Complementarity: The diversity of species in an ecosystem can provide redundancy, where multiple species perform similar functions, and complementarity, where different species perform unique functions. This redundancy and complementarity can increase the resilience of the ecosystem.

4. Biotic Interactions: In diverse ecosystems, complex interactions between species can create negative feedback loops that help to regulate populations and prevent the dominance of a single species. This can contribute to the overall stability of the ecosystem.

5. Examples: The diversity-resistance hypothesis has been studied in various ecological contexts, including the resistance of diverse plant communities to invasive species, the resistance of coral reefs to bleaching events, and the resistance of forests to pest outbreaks.

The diversity-resistance hypothesis is an important concept in ecology and conservation biology. It highlights the value of maintaining high levels of biodiversity in natural ecosystems to enhance their ability to withstand and recover from disturbances, which can contribute to the long-term health and stability of ecosystems. This hypothesis is also relevant to discussions about the conservation of biodiversity and the management of ecosystems in the face of environmental changes.
