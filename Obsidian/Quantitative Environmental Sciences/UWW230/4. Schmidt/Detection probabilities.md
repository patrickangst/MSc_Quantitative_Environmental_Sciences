#### $E(C)=N*P$

The expected count is the product of the true number of individuals/populations/species times detection probability.

This simple equation is extremely useful when you think about measuring distribution and abundance.

This is most important if you want to compare 2 or more counts.
You may get differences among species, among habitats or among years that are artefacts.

$C_1 >C_2 ? â†’N_1*p_1 >N_2*p_2$
When comparing two counts you (tacitly) assume that the p are equal. Unfortunately,
* p is rarely constant
* p is rarely 1

The solution is rather simple: Estimate p and adjust C.

$N = C/p$

This equation is, at least conceptually, the basis of all methods that are you for estimating distribution and abundance (that I consider reliable ...).
