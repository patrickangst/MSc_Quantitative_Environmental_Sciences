In the realm of ecology, a model refers to a simplified representation or abstraction of a real ecological system, often created to understand, predict, or simulate the behavior, interactions, or dynamics of organisms within ecosystems. Models in ecology can range from conceptual diagrams to mathematical equations or computer simulations.
