Extinction debt refers to the future extinctions of species that are already on a path to decline but have not yet disappeared from an ecosystem or a habitat. This concept arises from the time delay between the degradation of habitats or alteration of environmental conditions and the subsequent actual extinction of species.

When a habitat is altered or destroyed due to factors like deforestation, habitat fragmentation, pollution, or climate change, the species living in that habitat may not immediately go extinct. Instead, some species might persist for a period, even though the conditions for their survival have deteriorated. This delay between the decline of habitat quality and the eventual disappearance of species is referred to as the extinction debt.

Several factors contribute to the existence of an extinction debt:

1. **Habitat Degradation:** Destruction or fragmentation of habitats reduces the available space and resources for species. Even if some species can survive in the altered habitat initially, their populations might dwindle over time due to reduced reproductive success, increased competition, or limited resources.
    
2. **Slow Population Responses:** Species may have a delayed response to environmental changes. They might persist for a while through decreased reproduction or increased mortality, eventually leading to population declines and eventual extinctions.
    
3. **Time Lag:** The extinction debt concept suggests that there's a time delay between the onset of habitat degradation and the actual disappearance of species. This time lag can vary for different species and ecosystems.
    

Extinction debt highlights the importance of considering long-term consequences of habitat destruction and environmental changes. Even if immediate conservation actions are taken, some species may still face eventual extinction due to the impacts of past disturbances. Understanding and predicting extinction debts can be vital for conservation strategies, as it emphasises the need for proactive measures to preserve habitats and species before irreversible losses occur.
