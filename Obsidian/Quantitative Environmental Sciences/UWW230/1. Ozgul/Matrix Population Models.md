Life goes through stages. When there are obvious differences in the performances of different life history stages and these differences are hypothesised to be important, we use structured population models.

### Asymptotic population growth, λ

### Stable stage distribution, vλ
When scaled appropriately, the right eigenvector associated with λ gives the asymptotic proportion of individuals in each (st)age class.

#### Example

### Reproductive value, wλ
* There is also a left eigenvector (w) which gives reproductive values of each stage for the population at equilibrium structure
* Reproductive value (Fisher 1930): 
	* “To what extent will persons of this age, on the average, contribute to the ancestry of future generations?
	* This question is of some interest, since the direct action of Natural Selection must be proportional to this contribution.”
* Reproductive value = Current Reproduction + Residual Reproductive Value

### Why are matrix models so popular?
* Easy to model populations with complex life-histories
* Powered by coherent theories
* Asymptotic and transient dynamics straightforward
* Analytical solution to prospective and retrospective perturbation analysis
* Flexible and powerful; can handle complexities
* Management applications
* Amenable to rigorous parameterisation
* User- and computer- friendly
