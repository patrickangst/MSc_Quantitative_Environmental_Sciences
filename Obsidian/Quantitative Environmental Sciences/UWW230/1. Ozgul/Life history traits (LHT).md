Life history traits, in biology and ecology, refer to a set of characteristics and strategies exhibited by organisms that describe how they allocate resources and energy throughout their lifespan. These traits are crucial for understanding an organism's adaptation to its environment and its reproductive strategies. Common life history traits include:

1. **Reproduction**:
   - **Semelparity**: Organisms reproduce only once in their lifetime, often with a single large reproductive event.
   - **Iteroparity**: Organisms reproduce multiple times during their lifetime, with smaller reproductive events.

2. **Reproductive Age and Effort**:
   - **Age at First Reproduction**: The age at which an organism starts reproducing.
   - **Reproductive Effort**: The amount of energy and resources invested in reproduction.

3. **Offspring Number and Size**:
   - **High Fecundity**: Producing many offspring, often with low individual investment in each.
   - **Low Fecundity**: Producing fewer offspring but with a higher individual investment.

4. **Survivorship and Longevity**:
   - **High Survivorship**: A strategy that favours the survival of a large portion of offspring.
   - **Low Survivorship**: A strategy that produces many offspring with the expectation that few will survive to adulthood.
   - **Longevity**: The lifespan of an organism.

5. **Growth and Development**:
   - **Fast Growth**: Rapid development and growth to maturity.
   - **Slow Growth**: Slower development and maturation, often associated with longer lifespans.

6. **Parental Care**:
   - **No Parental Care**: Organisms provide little or no care for their offspring.
   - **Intensive Parental Care**: Organisms invest a significant amount of time and resources in caring for their offspring.

7. **Reproductive Mode**:
   - **Sexual Reproduction**: Involves the fusion of gametes from two parents, introducing genetic diversity.
   - **Asexual Reproduction**: Involves the creation of genetically identical offspring from a single parent.

8. **Dispersal**:
   - **High Dispersal**: Offspring tend to disperse widely from their place of birth.
   - **Low Dispersal**: Offspring remain close to their place of birth.

9. **Resource Allocation ([[principle of allocation]])**:
   - **[[life history trade-offs]]**: Organisms often face trade-offs between the allocation of resources to growth, reproduction, and survival.

These life history traits vary across different species and are influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, predation pressures, resource availability, and ecological niches. The specific combination of traits in an organism's life history reflects its evolutionary adaptation to its particular ecological niche and can significantly impact its population dynamics and survival.
