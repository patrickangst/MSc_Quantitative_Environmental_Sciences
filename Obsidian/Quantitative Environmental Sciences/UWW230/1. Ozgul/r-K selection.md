A heuristic (and much debated) way to classify species based on Verhulstâ€™s logistic equation of population regulation:

* r-selected = high growth rate (r)
* K-selected = subsist near the carrying capacity of their environment (K)
* Attempt to place species along the r-K continuum
* Fast-slow continuum (Promislow & Harvey 1990)

* See Gaillard et al. (1989) and Stearns (1992) for criticism of the r-K selection theory for focusing on density-dependent selection.
* The r-K selection paradigm was replaced by new paradigm that focused on age specific mortality and reproduction (Wilbur et al. 1974, Stearns 1976, Charlesworth 1980):
	* a more mechanistic link between an environment and an optimal life history
	* age / stage structured models as a framework (next section)
