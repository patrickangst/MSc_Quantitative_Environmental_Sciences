"Invasiveness" refers to the ability or tendency of something, typically a biological organism or a medical procedure, to invade or penetrate a particular area, structure, or system. This term is often used in the context of invasive species, medical procedures, or even technology. Here are a few specific examples:

- Adaptation for
	- Establishment from small populations – Fast spread  
	- Disturbed habitat  
	- Spread in heterogeneous habitat
- Many invasiveness traits are associated with these conditions: – Fast growth
	- Rapid regeneration  
	- Small seed / high reproductive output
	- Selfing
	- Generalized pollination or seed dispersal – Phenotypic plasticity
- Best predictor: Invasive elsewhere
