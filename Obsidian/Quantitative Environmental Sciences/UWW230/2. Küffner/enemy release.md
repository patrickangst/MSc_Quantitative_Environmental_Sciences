"Enemy release" is a concept in ecology that refers to a situation in which an invasive species, when introduced into a new environment, experiences a decrease in the impact of its natural enemies, such as predators, parasites, or pathogens, compared to its native habitat. This reduced pressure from natural enemies can provide invasive species with a competitive advantage over native species in the new environment.
