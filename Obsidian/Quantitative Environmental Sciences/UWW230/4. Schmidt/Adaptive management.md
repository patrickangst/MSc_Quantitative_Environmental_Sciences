Example: Adaptive management of ducks.
- The goal is to maintain a healthy duck population in the US and to set quota for hunters.
- How many ducks can be harvested each year?
- Different candidate models for the dynamics of duck populations:
	- hunting causes additive mortality vs. compensatory mortality
	- density dependence is strong vs weak
* Create 4 population models and compare model predictions to monitoring data.
