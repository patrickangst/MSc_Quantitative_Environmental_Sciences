Darwin's naturalisation hypothesis is a concept in ecology proposed by Charles Darwin in the mid-19th century. This hypothesis suggests that non-native species introduced to a new environment will only become successfully established and thrive if the ecological conditions in the new environment are similar to those in their native habitat. In other words, species that are closely related to the native species of the area they are introduced to are more likely to establish themselves in that environment.

Key points of Darwin's naturalisation hypothesis:

1. Ecological Similarity: The hypothesis is based on the idea that the more similar the ecological conditions of the new environment are to those of the species' native habitat, the more likely the introduced species is to survive, reproduce, and become established in the new location.

2. Competition and Adaptation: Darwin also noted that the success of introduced species may be hindered by competition with native species. Species that can adapt to the local conditions and compete effectively with native species are more likely to naturalise successfully.

3. Taxonomic Relationships: According to Darwin's hypothesis, species closely related to native species in the introduced area may have a better chance of becoming established because they share more ecological traits and adaptations.

4. Contemporary Ecological Understanding: While Darwin's naturalisation hypothesis laid the groundwork for understanding the establishment of non-native species, contemporary ecological research has provided a more nuanced view, taking into account factors such as competition, environmental changes, and multiple ecological interactions.

Darwin's naturalisation hypothesis is one of the early ideas in invasion ecology, and it contributed to our understanding of the dynamics of introduced species in new environments. However, it is important to note that the success of non-native species in ecosystems is influenced by a complex interplay of ecological factors, and the hypothesis is just one part of a broader understanding of invasion biology.
