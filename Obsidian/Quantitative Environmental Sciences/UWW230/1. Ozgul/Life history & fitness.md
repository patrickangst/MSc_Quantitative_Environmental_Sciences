* [[Life history traits (LHT)]] are shaped by natural selection to produce the largest possible number of surviving offspring into future generations.
* [[Life history traits (LHT)]] = fitness components. Many of them are demographic rates of the considered organism.
* [[Fitness]]: expected genetic contribution of an individual or genotype to future generations
* Natural selection is expected to favour a combination of traits that maximise fitness
