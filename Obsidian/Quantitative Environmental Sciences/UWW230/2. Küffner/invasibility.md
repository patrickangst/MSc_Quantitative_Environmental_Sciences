Invasibility (habitat vulnerability)

Anthropogenic habitats are more invaded
* Anthropogenic disturbances
* Resource-rich environments

Empty niche opportunities
* [[Diversity-resistance hypothesis]]
* [[Darwin's naturalization hypothesis]]

Biogeographic patterns
* Islands > Continents (empty niches?) --> less species, easier to invade
* Temperate > Tropical (diversity effect?) --> more species, more diverse --> more difficult to invade (See [[Diversity-resistance hypothesis]])
