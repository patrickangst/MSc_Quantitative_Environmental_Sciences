- You canâ€˜t measure all parts of biodiversity.
- People look for taxonomic groups that are representative for overall biodiversity.
- The approach is probably ok, but if you have a clear [[Why]] question then you may know which species to monitor.
- Choice of taxonomic groups may also depend on the audience and purpose of the monitoring.
- To convince a general audience, it may be better to show that butterflies are declining (popular animals) rather than a decline in the species richness of slugs.
- From an ecosystem service perspective, slugs may be more important than butterflies.
